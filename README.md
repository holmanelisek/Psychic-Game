# Psychic-Game
_The Pyschic Game is a letter guessing game!_
_A letter is randomly selected, for the user to attempt to guess._
_From there, the user has 9 chances to guess the letter, with previous guesses and number of guesses left displayed._
_If the user guesses correctly, the game resets, adding one to their win count._
_If the user does not guess the correct letter in 9 guesses, they lose! The game resets, and it's time to try again._
